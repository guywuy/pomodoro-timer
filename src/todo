For some reason once time input is submitted, value is lost and time is reset to before input... Due to form submission refreshing page...? But ev.preventDefault doesn't stop it.
One solution which simplifies things is to remove 'time-display' p entirely, just have form input with no submission, no border, no state needed for 'editing' in timesetter.
Constrain number input to integers (or format pomodoro time display to no decimal places....)
AND/OR add a range input.

Able to hold mouse down to increment/decrement time instead of requiring clicks..... held value increases slowly then fast as it is held longer.

On main pomo, only show a time when it's running or paused... otherwise just a big START


Style pomodiv with border that marks progress as border circle growing round to 360degrees.

Add cancel button to stop timer and reset to whatever pomo amount is.
