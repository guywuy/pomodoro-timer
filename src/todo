Create 'reverse time formatter' so user can input in minutes and it is sent as seconds. (easy - just multiply input by 60...)

Able to click on timesetters and type in the amount of time instead of using buttons. (change cursor too).
OR add a range input.
Able to hold mouse down to increment/decrement time instead of requiring clicks..... held value increases slowly then fast as it is held longer.

On main pomo, only show a time when it's running or paused... otherwise just a big START


Style pomodiv with border that marks progress as border circle growing round to 360degrees.

Add cancel button to stop timer and reset to whatever pomo amount is.
