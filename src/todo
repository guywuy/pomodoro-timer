Format time in minutes and seconds. - Allow for hours or set limit.
Create 'reverse time formatter' so user can input in minutes and it is sent as seconds. (easy - just multiply input by 60...)
Add functions for incrementing and decrementing time, and corresponding buttons. Limit of max 2 hours, min 1 minute.
Able to click on timesetters and type in the amount of time instead of using buttons. (change cursor too)
Style divs with background that increments as time is used up. Or border to circle round to 360degrees.
Add cancel button to stop timer and reset to whatever pomo amount is.
