Format time in minutes and seconds. - Allow for hours or set limit.

Create 'reverse time formatter' so user can input in minutes and it is sent as seconds. (easy - just multiply input by 60...)

Able to click on timesetters and type in the amount of time instead of using buttons. (change cursor too).
OR add a range input.
Add limit to times that you can set (e.g. minimum 1 minute, max 2 hours).


Style divs with background that increments as time is used up. Or border to circle round to 360degrees.

Add cancel button to stop timer and reset to whatever pomo amount is.
