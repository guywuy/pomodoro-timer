Constrain number input to integers (or format pomodoro time display to no decimal places....)
AND/OR add a range input.

Able to hold mouse down to increment/decrement time instead of requiring clicks..... held value increases slowly then fast as it is held longer.

On main pomo, only show a time when it's running or paused... otherwise just a big START


Style pomodiv with border that marks progress as border circle growing round to 360degrees.

Add cancel button to stop timer and reset to whatever pomo amount is.
